## animationEasingFn variable

A cubic-bezier function that defines the easing curve for animations. This easing function starts and ends slowly, with a faster middle phase.

The control points for the cubic-bezier function are: - (0.5, 0.0): The first control point, which defines the initial slope of the curve. - (0.5, 1): The second control point, which defines the ending slope of the curve.

This easing function can be used to create smooth animations that have a consistent speed throughout.

**Signature:**

```typescript
animationEasingFn = "cubic-bezier(0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1)"
```
