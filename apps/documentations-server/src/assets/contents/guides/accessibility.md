# Accessibility Guide
## Native Screen Readers

Screen readers are essential tools for users with visual impairments. Ensure your application is compatible with popular screen readers such as:

- **NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access)**: A free and open-source screen reader for Windows.
- **JAWS (Job Access With Speech)**: A widely-used screen reader for Windows.
- **VoiceOver**: A built-in screen reader for macOS and iOS devices.
- **TalkBack**: A screen reader for Android devices.

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Landmarks

Landmarks help users navigate your application more easily. Use HTML5 elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` to define the structure of your content.

### 2. Provide Text Alternatives

Ensure that all non-text content, such as images, videos, and audio files, have text alternatives. This helps users who rely on screen readers to understand the content.

### 3. Ensure Focus Visibility

Make sure that the focus indicator is visible when navigating through interactive elements using the keyboard. This helps users understand which element is currently focused.

```css
button:focus {
  outline: 2px solid #005fcc;
}
```

### 4. Avoid Using Only Color to Convey Information

Do not rely solely on color to convey important information. Use text labels, patterns, or icons in addition to color to ensure that the information is accessible to users with color blindness.

### 5. Provide Clear Instructions

Provide clear and concise instructions for all interactive elements, such as forms and buttons. This helps users understand how to interact with your application.

### 6. Test with Real Users

Conduct usability testing with real users, including those with disabilities, to identify and address accessibility issues. This helps ensure that your application is truly accessible to everyone.

By following these best practices, you can create a more inclusive and accessible web application.
