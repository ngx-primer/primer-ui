# Core Concept

## Overview

`ngx-primer` is a powerful Angular library designed to streamline the development process by providing a set of reusable components and utilities. It aims to enhance productivity and maintainability by adhering to best practices and offering a consistent development experience. The library is built with a focus on modularity, allowing developers to pick and choose the components and utilities they need without unnecessary bloat. This makes `ngx-primer` suitable for projects of all sizes, from small applications to large enterprise solutions.

## Key Features

- **Reusable Components**: A collection of pre-built, customizable components that can be easily integrated into any Angular application. These components are designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing developers to tailor them to their specific needs while maintaining a consistent API.
- **Utilities**: A set of helper functions and services to simplify common tasks and reduce boilerplate code. These utilities cover a wide range of functionalities, from state management to DOM manipulation, making it easier to implement complex features with minimal effort.
- **Consistency**: Ensures a uniform look and feel across the application by following a consistent design language. This consistency not only improves the user experience but also makes the codebase easier to maintain and scale.
- **Performance**: Optimized for performance to ensure fast and responsive applications. `ngx-primer` components are built with performance in mind, leveraging Angular's change detection and rendering mechanisms to minimize unnecessary re-renders and improve load times.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation to help developers get started quickly and understand the library's capabilities. The documentation includes detailed guides, API references, and examples to illustrate how to use each component and utility effectively.

## Getting Started

To start using `ngx-primer`, install it via npm:

```bash
npm install @ngx-primer/core
```

Import the necessary modules into your Angular application:

```typescript
import { PrimerModule } from '@ngx-primer/core';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    PrimerModule,
    // other imports
  ],
  // other configurations
})
export class AppModule { }
```

## Conclusion

`ngx-primer` is an essential tool for Angular developers looking to improve their workflow and build high-quality applications efficiently. By leveraging its reusable components and utilities, developers can focus on creating unique features rather than reinventing the wheel.

## Primitive Components

`ngx-primer` also embraces the concept of primitive components, similar to libraries like Radix UI or Shad CN. These primitives are low-level, renderless components that provide the building blocks for creating complex UI elements. They are designed to be highly flexible and agnostic in terms of styling, allowing developers to apply their own design systems and styles. By using primitive components, developers can create highly customizable and reusable UI elements that can adapt to different design requirements and use cases.

### Renderless Components

Renderless components in `ngx-primer` separate logic from presentation. They handle the state and behavior of UI elements without dictating how they should be rendered. This approach provides maximum flexibility, enabling developers to create custom UI components that fit their specific needs. By decoupling logic from presentation, renderless components make it easier to manage and test the business logic of your application, leading to more maintainable and scalable code.

### Agnostic Styles

By being agnostic in terms of styling, `ngx-primer` primitives do not impose any specific design language. Instead, they allow developers to apply their own styles, ensuring that the components can seamlessly integrate with any design system or branding guidelines. This flexibility allows teams to maintain a consistent visual identity across different projects while leveraging the powerful features provided by `ngx-primer`.

These primitive components empower developers to build highly customizable and reusable UI elements, enhancing the overall development experience and ensuring consistency across the application.
