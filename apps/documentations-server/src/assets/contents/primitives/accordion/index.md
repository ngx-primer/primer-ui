### Quick Start
To use the Accordion Primitive Component in an Angular project, include it in your module and configure the sections you want to be collapsible. Below is a basic example:

1. Install the component library:
  ```bash
  npm install @ngx-primer/accordion
  ```

2. Import the module in your Angular application:
  ```typescript
  import { NgxPrimerAccordionModule } from '@ngx-primer/accordion';

  @NgModule({
    imports: [NgxPrimerAccordionModule],
  })
  export class AppModule {}
  ```

3. Use the component in your template:
  ```html
  <ngx-primer-accordion>
    <ngx-primer-accordion-item title="Section 1">
     Content for section 1.
    </ngx-primer-accordion-item>

    </ngx-primer-accordion-item>
  </ngx-primer-accordion>
  ```

### Prim

#### Root Component
The `root` component serves as the container for the entire accordion. It manages the state and behavior of the accordion, ensuring that only one section is expanded at a time if desired.

#### Item Component
The `item` component represents an individual item within the accordion. Each item can be expanded or collapsed independently, allowing users to interact with specific sections of content.

#### Content Component
The `content` component holds the details or information to be displayed when an item is expanded. This is where you place the main content that you want to show or hide.

#### Trigger Component
The `trigger` component handles user interactions to expand or collapse an item. It typically includes a button or clickable element that users can interact with to toggle the visibility of the content.

### Example Usage
